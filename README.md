Heart Disease prediction:
1.Preprocess the data 
2.Preprocessing includes checking for null values, replace null values,encoding the ordinal values, normalization.
3.Split the dependent and independent columns as y and x
4.Using train-test-split function split the train data and test data
5.Train the data with different types of model such as linear regression, decision tree, random forest, SVM, xg boost.
6. Evaluate the accuracy of each model, to gain the parameters that shows good accuracy , we use grid searchcv.
7. From the above random forest shows the highest accuracy of 86%.
